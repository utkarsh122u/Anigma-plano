# 🏆 Hackathon Pitch – AI-Powered Learning Platform

## 🔥 Problem Statement

* College students ke paas **personalized learning system** ka option nahi hai.
* Instructors ko **track karna mushkil hota hai** ki kaunsa student kahan weak hai.
* Current systems me **resources scattered hote hai** → notes alag, quizzes alag, progress tracking alag.
